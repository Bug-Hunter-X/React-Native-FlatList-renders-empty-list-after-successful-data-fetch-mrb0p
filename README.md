# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of data fetching and how it interacts with the component's state.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` fetches data from a sample API endpoint. Despite the data being fetched correctly, the `FlatList` remains empty. This is because the component may render before the data is completely fetched and set into state.  The `ActivityIndicator` displays while loading but disappears and shows empty list instead of the expected data. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully handling asynchronous operations using `useEffect` and checking the loading and error states before rendering the `FlatList`.
